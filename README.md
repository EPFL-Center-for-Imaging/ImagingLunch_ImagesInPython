# Imaging Lunch: Introduction to Python for Image Analysis

**Abstract**

> This imaging lunch is designed for individuals with a basic understanding of Python who are eager to delve into scientific image processing. Our session will cover a comprehensive range of topics, including loading and saving images, representing images as arrays, visualizing images, cropping and slicing, utilizing masks and label images, and exploring various packages for advanced image manipulation. Additionally, we will address the handling of 2D, 3D, and time-lapse images to provide a well-rounded understanding of scientific images in Python.
